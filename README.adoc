== Operations

The site is hosted on AWS using S3 behind CloudFront (CF).

=== Getting started

Exact AWS service setup is outside of the scope of this README.

Obtain from your operations contact an inventory .rc file relevant
to the environment youâ€™re deploying.

It would contain the variables such as S3_BUCKET, HOSTNAME, AWS_REGION,
CF_DISTRIBUTION. Do not version that file in the repository.
